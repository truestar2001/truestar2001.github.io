        <p>
          I am a M.S. student at POSTECH. My research focuses on Speech Synthesis, Emotional Voice Conversion, and Automatic Music Mixing & Mastering. 
          As a passionate hobbyist composer, I enjoy creating music inspired by J-POP bands and actively play keyboard and synthesizer — as well as vocals and bass. 
          My vision is to help build a world where anyone can express their inner universe through composition.
